it matters when yiou call with parenthesos in js
the render function changes the html based on the state
dispatch is a function already included in the store redux object
you display an event to the action object  the action must include a tupe
once you make the the dispatch you go back to the reducedr and initlaizwe state with a [] and an action object
do not change state in the reducer just make a copy with object.assign([],state)
we got to call render inside the sgut taking the action 
disptch event
reducer take all the logic for diffeent events

1st creat reducer 
then store with reducer  then get state  to get state of data
then use store to dispatch an event to change the state 

// 
git add . to add all the files
then git commit - to save to git in my computer like a memory card
then hook up to remote repository to push to github site
git remote add orgin (origin here)
git push orgin (branch)

actions gets deispatch to the store

when you click make a dispact from the store in the function
